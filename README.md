Kubernetes have advanced networking capabilities that allow Pods and Services to communicate inside the cluster's network and externally.

In this scenario, you will learn the following types of Kubernetes services.

    Cluster IP
    Target Ports
    NodePort
    External IPs
    Load Balancer

Kubernetes Services are an abstract that defines a policy and approach on how to access a set of Pods. The set of Pods accessed via a Service is based on a Label Selector.

Step 1 - Cluster IP

Cluster IP is the default approach when creating a Kubernetes Service. The service is allocated an internal IP that other components can use to access the pods.

By having a single IP address it enables the service to be load balanced across multiple Pods.

Services are deployed via kubectl apply -f clusterip.yaml.

The definition can be viewed at cat clusterip.yaml

This will deploy a web app with two replicas to showcase load balancing along with a service. The Pods can be viewed at kubectl get pods

It will also deploy a service. kubectl get svc

More details on the service configuration and active endpoints (Pods) can be viewed via kubectl describe svc/webapp1-clusterip-svc

After deploying, the service can be accessed via the ClusterIP allocated.

export CLUSTER_IP=$(kubectl get services/webapp1-clusterip-svc -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')
echo CLUSTER_IP=$CLUSTER_IP
curl $CLUSTER_IP:80

Multiple requests will showcase how the service load balancers across multiple Pods based on the common label selector.

curl $CLUSTER_IP:80

Step 2 - Target Port

Target ports allows us to separate the port the service is available on from the port the application is listening on. TargetPort is the Port which the application is configured to listen on. Port is how the application will be accessed from the outside.

Similar to previously, the service and extra pods are deployed via kubectl apply -f clusterip-target.yaml

The following commands will create the service.

cat clusterip-target.yaml

kubectl get svc

kubectl describe svc/webapp1-clusterip-targetport-svc

After the service and pods have deployed, it can be accessed via the cluster IP as before, but this time on the defined port 8080.

export CLUSTER_IP=$(kubectl get services/webapp1-clusterip-targetport-svc -o go-template='{{(index .spec.clusterIP)}}')
echo CLUSTER_IP=$CLUSTER_IP
curl $CLUSTER_IP:8080

curl $CLUSTER_IP:8080

The application itself is still configured to listen on port 80. Kubernetes Service manages the translation between the two.


Step 3 - NodePort

While TargetPort and ClusterIP make it available to inside the cluster, the NodePort exposes the service on each Nodeâ€™s IP via the defined static port. No matter which Node within the cluster is accessed, the service will be reachable based on the port number defined.

kubectl apply -f nodeport.yaml

When viewing the service definition, notice the additional type and NodePort property defined cat nodeport.yaml

kubectl get svc

kubectl describe svc/webapp1-nodeport-svc

The service can now be reached via the Node's IP address on the NodePort defined.

curl 172.17.0.87:30080


Step 4 - External IPs

Another approach to making a service available outside of the cluster is via External IP addresses.

Update the definition to the current cluster's IP address with 

sed -i 's/HOSTIP/172.17.0.109/g' externalip.yaml

cat externalip.yaml

kubectl apply -f externalip.yaml

kubectl get svc

kubectl describe svc/webapp1-externalip-svc

The service is now bound to the IP address and Port 80 of the master node.

curl 172.17.0.109


the 10.10.0.0/26 range defined in the configuration.

kubectl get pods -n kube-system

kubectl apply -f loadbalancer.yaml

The service is configured via a Load Balancer as defined in cat loadbalancer.yaml

While the IP address is being defined, the service will show Pending. When allocated, it will appear in the service list.

kubectl get svc

kubectl describe svc/webapp1-loadbalancer-svc

The service can now be accessed via the IP address assigned, in this case from the 10.10.0.0/26 range.

export LoadBalancerIP=$(kubectl get services/webapp1-loadbalancer-svc -o go-template='{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).ip}}')
echo LoadBalancerIP=$LoadBalancerIP
curl $LoadBalancerIP

curl $LoadBalancerIP
